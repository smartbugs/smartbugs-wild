This means\r\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.\r\n * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.\r\n *\r\n * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply\r\n * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*\r\n *\r\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\r\n * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\r\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.\r\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\r\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\r\n * these events, as it isn\u0027t required by the specification.\r\n *\r\n * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`\r\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\r\n * allowances.
