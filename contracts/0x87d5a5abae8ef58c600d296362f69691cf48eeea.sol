This means\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.\n * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.\n *\n * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply\n * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*\n *\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\n * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn\u0027t required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.\n */\ncontract GNAcoin is IERC20 {\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\n\n    mapping (address =\u003e uint256) private _balances;\n\n    mapping (address =\u003e mapping (address =\u003e uint256)) private _allowances;\n\n    uint256 private _totalSupply;\n    // Public variables of the token\n    string public name;\n    string public symbol;\n    uint8 public decimals = 1;\n\n\n    constructor(\n        uint256 initialSupply,\n        string memory tokenName,\n        string memory tokenSymbol\n    ) public {\n        name = tokenName;                                   // Set the name for display purposes\n        symbol = tokenSymbol;                               // Set the symbol for display purposes\n        _totalSupply = initialSupply * 10 ** uint256(decimals);  // Update total supply with the decimal amount\n        _balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender].add(_totalSupply);  \n        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, _totalSupply);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.totalSupply`.\n     */\n    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return _totalSupply;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.totalSupply`.\n     */\n    function _giveInitial(address account) internal {\n        _balances[account] = uint256(0);\n        _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(_totalSupply); \n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.balanceOf`.\n     */\n    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n        return _balances[account];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.transfer`.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `recipient` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`.\n     */\n    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {\n        _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.allowance`.\n     */\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256) {\n        return _allowances[owner][spender];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.approve`.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     */\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\n        _approve(msg.sender, spender, value);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev See `IERC20.transferFrom`.\n     *\n     * Emits an `Approval` event indicating the updated allowance.
