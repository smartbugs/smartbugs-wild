// Time for a Drink!!
// I drink all sorts of wines and beers, including very expensive ones. However, the most prevalent drink featured in one of my series is Taiwan Beer—a lager that belongs very much to the collective consciousness, if you will, of men in Taiwan. It reminds us of joyful times—bottoms up!
// Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai Shek with their arms around each other. This is something that we probably won’t find in the historical archives, but it is a scenario that appears in my paintings—the two reconciled, smiling. No doubt the viewer will notice that Chiang Kai-shek is holding a bottle of Taiwan Beer.
